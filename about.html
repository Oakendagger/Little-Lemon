                    <h1>The Little Lemon Story</h1>
                    <p> 
                        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean 
                        restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. 
                        The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and 
                        have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant 
                        has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a 
                        popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved 
                        to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. 
                        To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a 
                        chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the 
                        effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional 
                        cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
